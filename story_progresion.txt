capital ship  (introduction)

go to planetary lander(alone)
warp storm (oh shit)

se strica antena-- > repara antena (inquisitor with mechanicus training)

you find out that the thrusters are also fucked and that you are going to crash into the natural satelite at this point

realiniaza nava sa nu te prabusesti

after you are clear, you need to repair the thrusters to be able to land

you need to make a space walk to repair the thrusters. While doing that the second wave of warp storm hits and you will hang on for your life.
In the process you loose almost all your equipment except ur knife. You armor also gets damaged
